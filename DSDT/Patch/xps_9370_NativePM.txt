# Inject plugin-type=1 on _PR.CPU0
#
# This is experimental to see how only injecting plugin-type with native CPU PM SSDTs
# works on various platforms.
#
# Newer KabyLake/KabyLake-R/CoffeeLake boards use _PR.PR00, or _PR.P000 as first CPU path.
# Adjust this code according to what you find for Processor objects in your own DSDT.
